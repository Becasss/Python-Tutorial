# Python Lists : mylist = ["apple", "orange", "cherry"]

# List are used to store multiple items in a single variable
# Example:
thislist = ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry']
print(thislist)



# Lits Items : are orderd, changeable and allow duplicate values


# Ordered : if you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list

# Changeable: meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

# Allow Duplicates : Since list are indexed, lists can have items with the same value.
# Example: 
list1 = ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'apple']
print(list1)
print(list1[3])


# List Length: len() function

print(len(list1))
